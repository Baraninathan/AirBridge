## Configuration

### Serial Monitor

Connect via serial monitor at **115200 baud** for debug output.

Enable verbose logging in `config.h`:
```cpp
const bool show_data = true;  // Enable detailed serial logs
```

### Temperature Sensor Setup

Place sensors carefully for accurate readings:

**Room Sensor:**
- Representative location in room
- Avoid direct sunlight or drafts
- Same height as AC air intake

**Coil Sensor (Optional):**
- Attach to AC evaporator coil
- Good thermal contact (use thermal paste)
- Insulate from ambient air

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**LED Patterns:**
- Green blinks 2x = IR signal received
- Yellow blinks = System warning
- Both flash 3x = WiFi connected
- No LEDs = Power issue

**IR Not Working:**
1. Check IR LED has current-limiting resistor (100-220Ω)
2. Verify IR LED is positioned with line-of-sight to AC
3. Check detected protocol in serial monitor
4. Try different IR LED (some ACs need specific wavelength)

**WiFi Won't Connect:**
1. Verify SSID and password are correct
2. Check WiFi signal strength
3. Reset device and reconfigure
4. Access point auto-closes after 20 loops (~2 minutes)

**Temperature Sensors Not Reading:**
1. Check 4.7kΩ pull-up resistor is connected
2. Verify DS18B20 sensors are genuine (many fakes)
3. Test sensors with multimeter (~10kΩ at 25°C)
4. Check connections to GPIO2
